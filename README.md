# speckle-chat
Webhook relay for Speckle Server to Google Chat

This is a Firebase Cloud Function that when deployed activates an endpoint usable in defining Speckle Webhooks. In turn it posts to Google Chat Spaces webhook as a Card format message with messages and gathers the commit or stream thumbnail.

Consider this pre-alpha, and yes **i have** baked in the url. Do not abuse :D

Todo:
- Offer configuration options via the UI

Longer
- Convert webhook relay into an installable bot
- Configuration steps to the bot on install for account and stream selection
